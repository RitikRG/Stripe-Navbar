## About this project 

### It looks something like this 
<img align="center" alt="Navbar" width="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106656982/214255660-f1dff1d9-d959-460c-8ed7-aa92a5ee8dfc.png">

### Why I made this
Since the day I visited stripe's website I have always wanted to recreate that navbar but I always knew that it's not going to be easy as their navbar probably contains more code than my previous protfolio. But yesterday I decided to give it a try and made this project. It took me around 8-10 hours of coding & thinking but I haven't used any sort of tutorial for this one.
